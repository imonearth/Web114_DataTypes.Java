I decide to create a Calculator. I thought this would be a fun practice utalizing what I have 
learned about numbers and utalizing number Strings with Java Script to produce something functional
and practical.  With this project I was able to further my understanding of how HTML and JavaScript relate
and the different Operators necessary to make the JS funtion.
